## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use the template Online SHop App, you need to have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Start by cloning the template repository from GitHub:

`bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  `

2. Navigate to the project directory:

`bash
  cd ecommerce-frontend
  `

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

`bash
  npm install
  `

### Folder Structure

After cloning and installing the template, the project directory will have the following structure:

```
ecommerce-frontend/
 README.md
 node_modules/
 package.json
 public/
  index.html
  favicon.ico
  ...
 src/
  assets/
   images
    ...
  components/
   AdSection.js
   CallToAction.js
   Cart.js
   ErrorBoundary.js
   Product.js
   Footer.js
   Nav.js
   ...
  Pages/
   CartPage.js
   NotFound.js
   HomePage.js
   ...
  App.css
  App.js
  index.css
  main.js
  ...
```

- `public/`: This folder contains the publicly accessible files, such as the HTML template (`index.html`) and favicon.
- `src/`: This folder contains the main source code files for the template.
- `src/assets/`: This folder contains any images or media files used in the template.
- `src/components/`: This folder contains individual components that make up the different sections of the portfolio.
- `src/Pages/`: This folder contains Pages that the entire Web App needs.
- `App.js`: The main React component that renders the template.
- `index.js`: The entry point for the application.

## Customization

To personalize the Food Delivery and Local Restaurant Search App, you can make changes to various aspects of the template, and styling.

### Modifying Sections

The template includes several sections, such as About, Chat Support, Help, and Contact. You can modify or remove these sections as per your requirements.

1. Open the relevant component file located in the `src/components/` directory.

2. Customize the content within the component, such as the section title, text, or any other elements.

3. Save the file.

4. Update the navigation links in the `src/App.js` file to reflect the changes. Modify the `Nav` component to include or exclude the desired sections.

### Styling

You can customize the visual appearance of the template by modifying the codes with tailwind CSS. But you can create additional stylesheets or modify existing ones to suit your design preferences.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts using npm:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser. The page will reload automatically whenever you make changes to the source code. You can also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. This allows you to run tests for your components and ensure they work as expected.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build process bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for better performance. The output files are minified and have hashed filenames, ready to be deployed to a web server.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you need to customize the build tool and configuration choices provided by Create React App, you can eject from the default setup. Ejecting copies all the configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them. However, it's not recommended unless you have a good understanding of the underlying tools and are comfortable maintaining them.

## Deployment

To deploy your Food Delivery and Local Restaurant Search App to a web server, you can follow the deployment guide provided in the [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/).
